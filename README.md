# ClickWiki

A community Wiki-based website for [Clickteam](https://clickteam.com). This repository contains the
code and content delivering the wiki, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

The wiki aims to:

* Deliver facts, history and some documentation to Clickteam's products.
* Collate notable examples and user creations.
* Archive the growing number of extensions and features.

# Archived
As there hasn't been significant contributions since 2010, this project 
has been archived, preferring to remain a time capsule for an earlier era of Clickteam.


# Moved from MediaWiki
Previously, we've been using [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) to host the Wiki as a service. Our instance
has been getting a little rusty by being prone to cache issues. It also has the maintainance hurdle with the database,
software versions and protecting user information.

We've migrated to become a static site to reduce costs, boost speed, improve security (no more database) and flexibility.
