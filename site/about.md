ClickWiki is a community-driven wiki all about [Clickteam](/clickteam) The project
aims to cover their [products](/clickteam/history), [exporters](/exporters), [extensions](/extensions),
and even more with in-depth information. Our aim with the Wiki is to provide **fully documented pages**
that make finding **answers simple to find**. We strike for **detail** to enable you to
**discover more possibilities** for Fusion and your projects.

The Wiki acts as a bridge between the help documentation, centralising tips & tricks
and frequently asked solutions buried in the [Community Forums].

### Predecessors
During 2010-2012, there was an official encyclopedia for Clickteam named **FusionWiki**.
However, due to an unforeseen update failure, the Wiki was taken offline permanently
and had lost **all** of its content.

This Wiki isn't the first to create and write up about Clickteam's products and features.
Other Wikis do exist but may be in other languages, for specific communities or for different purposes.

Coincidentally, you may discover the name "ClickWiki" has been used in around 2007-2008 referring to
another vanished Wiki on the [Community Forums], but this is an entirely
different project with different people. You can think of this Wiki as the spiritual successor.
It's completely new, kickstarted by different clickers and aims to preserve the knowledge and hours
poured to build it.

### FAQs
###### **Are you endorsed by Clickteam?**
**No.** Besides being customers and users of their product. This project is not associated with Clickteam.
This Wiki is purely community ran and relies on your contributions to reach its full potential. That said,
members of the Clickteam have contributed and promoted our Wiki! You may have read about us in [Fused](/fused).

###### **Why was the wiki migrated from MediaWiki?**

* **Static** - No database, no waiting. Reduces costs.
* **GDPR compliance** - a new data protection law in the EU means that ClickWiki no longer stores any personal data, such as user logins.
* **Flexible** - being open source, anything can be edited.
* Our MediaWiki instance were prone to cache issues and the random "internal errors".
