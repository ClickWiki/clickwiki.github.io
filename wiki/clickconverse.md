**ClickConverse** was an official chat client used by the Clickteam staff and its
community members. The chat client is a successor to the previously used
[Gwerdy Chat](/gwerdy-chat/) and is built with [Multimedia Fusion 2]. It was
built and maintained by [Simon](http://community.clickteam.com/members/5109-Simon) at Clickteam.

It has since been superseded by the **[Click Converse Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/RfxPYvh)**.

Wine users (Mac/Linux) needed to install ie6, ie7 or ie8 winetricks to avoid a blank chat area.
