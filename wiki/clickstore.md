The **ClickStore** is an online content store where [Clickteam Fusion 2.5] users
and visitors can buy and download various resources for their projects. Users
can also register as a seller and upload their own content for the store. Users
determine their price and will receive 70% of the sale with 30% going to [Clickteam](/clickteam/),
who take care of the listings, delivery, payments, processing and fees. The
objective of the store is to provide a central hub for clickers and an opportunity
for users to show off their content.

Not to be confused with **[Clickteam's Shop](/clickteam/shop/)** for purchasing products and exporters.
