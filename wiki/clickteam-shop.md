The Clickteam Shop is the name given to purchasing products and exporters from
Clickteam directly. Current version of products such as [Fusion 2.5](/fusion/2.5/) and its exporters
are for sale, along with Tools such as [Install Creator](/tools/install-creator/). The shops are region-locked,
meaning that users are restricted to purchasing in their current region. Access
to other regions may prompt with an error message. Some connections behind proxies
may also fail to reach the shop, such as accessing on a corporate network.

Not to be confused with the asset shop, [ClickStore](/clickstore/).

## History
Clickteam has been trading online for a long time. In the run up of the release of [Fusion 2.5](/fusion/2.5/),
the shops were re-vamped and upgraded to reflect Clickteam's current branding. Previous shop
accounts were cleared meaning that purchases before December 2013 cannot be retrieved.
You are encouraged to contact Clickteam if you need this information.

## Regions
The shops are divided into 4 regions:

* [![USA](/wiki/assets/Locales/us.png) USA](https://shop.clickteam.com/usa/)
* [![UK](/wiki/assets/Locales/gb.png) UK](https://shop.clickteam.com/uk/)
* [<span class="fa fa-globe"></span> Europe](https://shop.clickteam.com/europe/)
* [<span class="fa fa-globe"></span> World](hhttps://shop.clickteam.com/world/)

Some stores may be inaccessible based on your location.

## Steam
Alternately, it may be cheaper for some countries to buy [Clickteam](/clickteam/)'s products and
exporters through Steam. By doing so, you are confined to Steam's distribution model,
which includes:

* Compulsory updates.
* Steam must be running to use.
* Fusion can only be open on one computer at a time.
* The ability to stream Fusion to any other computer in your house.

However, aside from Steam's requirements and In-Home Streaming, there are no technical
limitations between the stand alone product and Steam's version. Updates may take
longer to arrive and beta versions may not be always up-to-date, and you cannot mix
stand alone exporters with Steam exporters.
