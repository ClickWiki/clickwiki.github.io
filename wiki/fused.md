**Fused** is an official [Clickteam] blog edited by [Danny] from Clickteam. This news is designed to provide in-sight behind the scenes at Clickteam and around the community, featuring news for [Fusion 2.5] and [Fusion 3] in addition to game reviews and guides. The blog format was adopted [to provide quicker and more frequent updates](https://www.facebook.com/clickteam/posts/10153543937356356).

Originally, Fused! was a monthly PDF e-magazine started in October 2014 targetted for release on the 9th or 10th of each month, however the PDF format has since been dropped.

## Previous Releases
There is currently no "official" location for acquiring copies of the e-magazine. New issues are announced on the forums, the mailing list and the Fused! Facebook page.

However, a list has been gathered on the Wiki:
