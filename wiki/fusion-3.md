It is inevitable there is a new successor to [Fusion 2.5](/fusion/2.5) in the works. While it may be a while before this product is released, this page is dedicated to gathering confirmed rumours or hinted announcements regarding this mystery product. The new product will be re-written from scratch, meaning it will not be backwards compatible or maintain legacy code from [Klik & Play](/klik-and-play). Plus, the exporters and [potentially] cross-platform editors would be easier to build and maintain.

### From the Community



* **The product itself**
    * **Release Date**
      * Older posts suggested no firm release date. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/66628-Most-wanted-least-wanted-in-MMF3?p=511090&viewfull=1#post511090) [2](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/88943-Fusion-3-support-Fusion-2-5-MFA?p=642700&viewfull=1#post642700)
      * ~~Yves has clearly stated it will be released "next year" (2016). [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/92330-Fusion-3-Current-Status?p=664266&viewfull=1#post664266)~~
        * Clickteam from Facebook clearly says "No" to a 2016 release. [Evidence](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/92330-Fusion-3-Current-Status?p=689082&viewfull=1#post689082)
      * <strike>More information will be revealed "later this year" (2015). [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/92330-Fusion-3-Current-Status?p=664290&viewfull=1#post664290)</strike>
    * Extension development editing time is intended to be addressed. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/66628-Most-wanted-least-wanted-in-MMF3?p=580559&viewfull=1#post580559)
      * It will be much faster to create extensions that work on all platforms. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/92330-Fusion-3-Current-Status?p=664310&viewfull=1#post664310)
    * There will be a "quantum" leap in performance. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/66628-Most-wanted-least-wanted-in-MMF3?p=603864&viewfull=1#post603864)
    * The event editor style of coding isn't going anywhere. In fact, the successor has been described as "awesome". [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/91637-where-to-find-MMF3-news?p=661235&viewfull=1#post661235) [2](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/91637-where-to-find-MMF3-news?p=661322&viewfull=1#post661322)

* **Cross platform support**
    * Fusion 3 will be built with cross-platform libraries. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/73558-Open-Letter-to-Clickteam-Linux-(it-s-about-time)?p=543148&viewfull=1#post543148) [2](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/73558-Open-Letter-to-Clickteam-Linux-(it-s-about-time)?p=543152&viewfull=1#post543152)
    * The cross-platform libraries may be based on Qt. ~~[Blog](https://community.clickteam.com/entries/217-Fun-dation)~~ <sup>(Source no longer available)</sup>
    * Fusion 3 will run on at least Windows, Mac, and Linux, in addition to other platforms. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/73746-Who-s-upgrading-to-Windows-8?p=544717&viewfull=1#post544717) [2](http://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-blog?p=fusion-3-news-in-brief)

* **Exporters**
    * **Native C++** (or C) **export** with both native binaries and source code. (Similar to [Chowdren](chowdren)'s functionality) <sup>[(Confirmed)](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/92330-Fusion-3-Current-Status?p=667078&viewfull=1#post667078)</sup> [2](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/74080-Chowdren-Blazingly-fast-Fusion-exporter-for-desktop-amp-consoles?p=655930&viewfull=1#post655930) [3](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/74080-Chowdren-Blazingly-fast-Fusion-exporter-for-desktop-amp-consoles?p=655939&viewfull=1#post655939) [4](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/91015-Any-news-about-Clickteam-Fusion-3?p=655369&viewfull=1#post655369) [5](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/92330-Fusion-3-Current-Status?p=667078#post667078) [World Reveal Interview]
    * **The exporter model** (with purchases of additional exporters to export to multiple platforms) **will be kept** [World Reveal Interview]

* **Potentially new features**
    * It could be possible to copy/paste events as text. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/65304-Multimedia-Fusion-3?p=488247&viewfull=1#post488247)

* **Reduced limitations**
    * The restriction of alterable values can be overcome in Fusion 3. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/86943-Wish-list-for-Fusion-2-5!?p=631546&viewfull=1#post631546) [2](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/86943-Wish-list-for-Fusion-2-5!?p=631948&viewfull=1#post631948)
    * There are plans to make Android applications run in the background more viable for MMF3. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/79495-Will-android-apps-be-able-to-run-in-the-background?p=586588&viewfull=1#post586588) [2](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/91202-APP-running-in-background?p=656492#post656492)

* **New file format**
    * An importer/converter for [MFA](/file-extensions/mfa) files will be considered. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/88943-Fusion-3-support-Fusion-2-5-MFA?p=643674&viewfull=1#post643674) [2](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/88943-Fusion-3-support-Fusion-2-5-MFA?p=644040&viewfull=1#post644040) [3](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/88943-Fusion-3-support-Fusion-2-5-MFA?p=643534&viewfull=1#post643534)
      * It's possible it may only import assets, not full events. <sup>[Missing source]</sup>
      * The best advise is to not wait for Fusion 3 to start a new project. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/88943-Fusion-3-support-Fusion-2-5-MFA?p=642647&viewfull=1#post642647) [2](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/88943-Fusion-3-support-Fusion-2-5-MFA?p=642709&viewfull=1#post642709)
      * Yves stated the importer that will perform a large chunk of the conversion, but the product will not maintain full backwards compatibility. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/92330-Fusion-3-Current-Status?p=664322&viewfull=1#post664322)
    * The new file format may **store data across multiple files** as opposed to a monolithic format (such as [MFA](/file-extensions/mfa)) [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/92330-Fusion-3-Current-Status?p=664429&viewfull=1#post664429) [World Reveal Interview]
* **Support of existing products after launch**
    * ~~Updates for existing products **may** grind to a halt when Fusion 3 is out [1 (in French)](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/77983-mmf2-mmf3?p=576775&viewfull=1#post576775)~~
    * ~~Updates for Fusion 2.5 will continue for some time, particularly for bug fixes. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/88943-Fusion-3-support-Fusion-2-5-MFA?p=643160&viewfull=1#post643160)~~
    * Fusion 2.5 will continue to receive fixes and updates after Fusion 3 is released due to the differences between the products. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/97895-Is-the-Fusion-3-upgrade-free?p=697595&viewfull=1#post697595)

* **Miscellaneous**
    * Text scripting is very unlikely. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/65304-Multimedia-Fusion-3?p=487450&viewfull=1#post487450)
    * The name "Clickteam Fusion" will be dropped in favor of a new name, just "Fusion". <sup>Added by [Triadian](https://community.clickteam.com/members/23876-Triadian)</sup>

# Speculation and Rumours
**Members from the community recall announced facts about a feature.**

* Runtimes in Fusion 3 will share a **global runtime** (as opposed to branding into their own external engines) [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/66628-Most-wanted-least-wanted-in-MMF3?p=631141&viewfull=1#post631141) [2](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/66628-Most-wanted-least-wanted-in-MMF3?p=631165&viewfull=1#post631165)
* Fusion 3 will have **Git integration**. [1](https://community.clickteam.com/threads/66628-Most-wanted-least-wanted-in-MMF3?p=655695&viewfull=1#post655695)
* There may be support for **some** of these: Cross platform shaders, cross platform zoom, sub-events, (real) global events, renaming qualifiers and unique instances.
