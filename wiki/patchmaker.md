Patch Maker is a program for making update patches by [Clickteam](/clickteam). Patch Maker is the companion product to [Install Creator](/tools/install-creator-2/).

Patch Maker features a wizard to help you make your patches. The wizard asks you to provide the directory that contains the old version and the directory that contains the new version of your files, and then makes a patch between the two. It also lets you add various pages of text and change the background images.

Under Wizard Options, there is an option labeled Run As Administrator. If this is left unchecked, then users will not have to enter an administrator password to run the installer. The user will still be able to run it as admin by right-clicking the file and clicking Run As Administrator. If the program is not run as admin, it will give an error when attempted to modify files in admin-protected areas (including the Program Files folders).
