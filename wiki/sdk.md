# Creating Extensions for Fusion 2.5 & Fusion 2.5 Developer

The extension SDKs (Software Development Kits) allows you to create your very own extensions for Fusion 2.5 and the various export modules. 
You will need to know a little C++ and the export module language to create an extension.

Download the SDKs you wish to develop with and start developing your very own extensions. 
These extensions can magnify the power of your Fusion 2.5 applications and games. 
With the SDKs, you can create your own extensions that work with additional built-in platform functions, communicate with existing, 3rd-Party SDKs and APIs.
